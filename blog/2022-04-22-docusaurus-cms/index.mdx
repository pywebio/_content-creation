## Problem
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

Adding a Docusaurus powered blog and tutorial section to the existing PyWebIO website hosted on GitHub Pages. Docusaurus has excellent documentation on deploying to GitHub Pages. However, with a pre-existing deployed GitHub pages website, there is a need to add the Docusaurus generated static files to this deployment without disrupting the existing structure.

## Solution
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

The solution was to use Docusaurus to transform Markdown content files into static HTML files, and GitHub Actions to automatically build those files and deploy them from the Docusaurus repository to the pre-existing GitHub Pages repository.

## Requirements
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

1. A [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) source code repository (documentation repo).
    * Follow [Docusaurus' instructions](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for getting started in setting up a project.
    * Push this Docusaurus project to your documentation repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. A GitHub repository with a branch setup for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (GH Pages repo).

## Setup SSH Key
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

1. Generate a new SSH key using [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Do **not** add a passphrase. There is no need to add the key to your ssh-agent.
2. Go to your GH Pages repo on GitHub's website. Select the `Settings` tab. Then select `Deploy keys` from the sidebar on the left. 
3. Select `Add deploy key`. Add a title for the deploy key, and then paste the contents of the public SSH key (file ending with `.pub`) into the `Key` field. 
4. Be sure to select `Allow write access` and then select `Add key`.
5. Go to your documentation repo on GitHub's website. Select the `Settings` tab. In the sidebar to the left select `Secrets`, followed by `Actions`.
6. Select `New repository secret`. Select an [appropriate name](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#naming-your-secrets) for your secret. 
7. Paste the contents of the private SSH key file (should begin with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`) into the `Value` field, and then select `Add secret`.

## Setup GitHub Actions Workflow
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

1. From the root of your documentation repo create a [workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows#creating-a-workflow-file) with the following folder structure:
    * `.github/workflows/yourfile.yml`. 
    
    :::tip Note

    The filename can be of your choosing, example: `deploy.yml`.

    :::

2. The workflow file has two triggers, either a pull request or push to the `main` branch of the documentation repo.

```
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

3. The first job will run when there is a pull request to `main` and will checkout the source, install NPM, and then generate static files from the documentation source to ensure there are no build errors.

```
jobs:
  test-deploy:
    if: github.event_name != 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16.x
          cache: npm
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Test build website
        run: npm run build
```

4. The second job will run when there is a push to `main`. It will also checkout the source, install NPM, and generate static files. It will then deploy those static files to the pre-existing GH Pages repo.

```
deploy:
    if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16.x
          cache: npm
      - name: Install dependencies and build
        run: npm ci
      - name: Test build website
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_DEPLOY }}    #Be sure to select the name used for your secret
          external_repository: pywebio/pywebio.github.io    # GH Pages repo
          publish_dir: ./build
          publish_branch: main    # Branch in GH Pages repo set to be Source for GitHub Pages
          destination_dir: docs   # Directory to indicate path for your documentation from base URL. Ours will be pyweb.io/docs
          user_name: 'github-actions[bot]'
          user_email: 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
```

## Setup Docusaurus Configuration
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

Because we are placing our documentation static files nested in a path of the rest of our static webpage, it is important to update our `docusaurus.config.js` file in our documentation source. Change the `baseUrl` field to match the `destination_dir` selected in the workflow file's `actions-gh-pages@v3` step. For example, ours is `/docs/`.

## Conclusion
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

You should now be able to create content files for Docusaurus and have them auto-deploy once they are merged with your documentation source repository's `main` branch.
