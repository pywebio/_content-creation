PyWeb.io is looking to the future, and for some, that equals Web3. As humanity embarks down this new uncharted path, having a clean, customizable, and easy to implement front end doesn't have to be complicated. With most Web3 development options being JavaScript focused, the PyWeb.io and Web3.py libraries make it possible for Python developers to program end-to-end, from the blockchain to the web interface. Let's take a look at the latest demo app that uses some basic input and output functions to connect with the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3.py library and Infura.


## Web3.py and Infura
First, a brief summary of the Web3.py library and Infura. [**Web3.py**](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a python library that interacts with Ethereum. It provides functions to help with sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading block data, and a variety of other uses. The PyWeb.io demo only makes use of some of the read functions but you can certainly interact with the blockchain in much more complex ways. 

[**Infura**](https://infura.io/) essentially acts as a node on the Ethereum network. Through their API you are able to connect a web app to the blockchain without having to set up a node yourself, which would require a substantial amount of hard drive space and computing resources.

## Bring it All Together With PyWeb.io
A basic navbar with button links is used to change the view state between blocks, transactions, and charts in this simple one-page app. The web app allows a user to input a specific transaction or block number to see details. It also displays recent transactions and blocks in nicely formatted tables. Pop ups are used to get details on the  wallet addresses associated with transactions and miner associated with a specific block. The browser based graphing library Plotly is also used to provide a nice chart displaying block and miner data. All of this functionality in under 250 lines, and all written in Python.

## Conclusion

**WIP:**
PyWeb.io is ready to interact with today's tech, as well as tomorrows. See the source code on GitHub.
